# Coding-Quiz 

## Description

I've created this coding quiz for developers to test their knowledge on basic coding questions.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
When a user opens the quiz they will be presented with a button to start the quiz. Once the button is pressed they will be taken through a series of questions in which they can choose a correct answer or incorrect answer. A timer will begin at the start of the quiz. Based on the answer that the user provides the timer will determine the score. If the user answers incorrectly the timer will decrease by 10 seconds. At the end of the quiz the score will be displayed which will be the time remaining. The user will be able to input their name into the input box so that they can store the score.
